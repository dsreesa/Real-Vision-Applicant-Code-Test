Real Vision Code Test Write a small program that takes as input three pieces of information:

A text file containing a large amount of English-structured content. 
ex: “alice_in_wonderland.txt” https://gist.github.com/phillipj/4944029 
A text file containing “common” words, one word per line. 
ex: “common.txt” https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741) 
An integer. 
 Assume the text files will be placed in the same directory as your program file.  Output the top n words (from the user-given integer input) in descending order that recur in the given text file (alice_in_wonderland.txt), excluding any words that exist in the common words file (common_.txt).  The output should be in the following format:  

Count  Word 

===   ==== 

37      the 

32      and 

25      a 

18      of 

17      that 

12      is 

10      in 

5        with 

4        as 

1        not  



Utilize any programming language you want and provide clear instructions on how to run it.  Provide a link to a gist on GitHub containing your solution.  Plan to spend an hour or less, include the instructions to run it at the top of your gist in the form of comments.
